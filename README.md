# Design Patterns
Repository contains codes depicting various design patterns that are a part of gof design principles.

There are 3 types of design patterns:
1) Creational Design Pattern
2) Structural Design Pattern
3) Behavioural Design Pattern

## Creational Design Patterns 
These type of design patterns are used while working around creation of objects. Based on different scenarios
we have to identify which creational pattern to implement.

Mentioned below are the 7 creational design patterns:
1) Builder Pattern
2) [Simple Factory Pattern](src/main/java/org/hklearning/creational/simplefactory/SimpleFactory.md)
3) [Factory Pattern](src/main/java/org/hklearning/creational/factorymethod/FactoryMethod.md)
4) [Prototype Pattern](src/main/java/org/hklearning/creational/prototype/Prototype.md)
5) Abstract Factory Pattern
6) Singleton Pattern
7) Object Pool Pattern

## Structural Design Patterns 
Structural Design Pattern deals with how classes and objects are structured, arranged or composed to increase 
code re-usability and simplify relations.

Mentioned below are the 7 structural design patterns:
1) [Adapter Pattern](src/main/java/org/hklearning/structural/adapter/Adapter.md)
2) Bridge Pattern
3) Decorator Pattern
4) Composite Pattern
5) Facade Pattern
6) Flyweight Pattern
7) Proxy Pattern

# Behavioural design Patterns
This design pattern deals with how objects interact, communicate and collaborate with each other to achieve a task efficiently.

Mention below are the 12 behavioural design patterns:
1) Chain of Responsibility Pattern
2) Command Pattern
3) Interpreter Pattern
4) Mediator Pattern
5) Iterator Pattern
6) Memento Pattern
7) Observer Pattern
8) State Pattern
9) Stratergy Pattern
10) Template Method Pattern
11) Visitor Pattern
12) Null Object
